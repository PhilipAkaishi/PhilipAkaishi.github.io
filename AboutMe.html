  <h1>Welcome to The "About Me" Tab</h1>
    <p>Come and learn a little bit about me</p>
  <h2> Where Did I Grow Up?</h2>
    <p class ="paragraph"> I grew up in Wisconsin, but moved around a lot as a child. My family was all born and raised
    in Brasil while I am the sole member of my entire family history to have been born in the United States.
    I have a brother who is 9 years older than me but we don't really talk much. Most of my childhood was spent in different
    parts of Wisconsin and also in Brasil visting my extended family.</p>
  <h2> My Life Post Middle School</h2>
    <p class="paragraph"> After middle school I began to start thinking more about my person and my looks so I joined sports teams
    and worked to make myself a better person. I eventually became captain of the varsity tennis team and was able to get into
    UW Madison. Being Bi-lingual going into High School was a huge help when trying to learn a foreign language and also helped
    me to make friends because I was able to help them with the material. Nothing out of the ordinary happened until I went to college
    where about 90% of the stories I tell people come from. It honestly Astonishes me how much you can do in a couple of years. I also
    got a new hobby of photographing a good sight whenever I see one and have steadily built up a small collection. Here is but a taste
    of the pictures that I have taken (Warning, it is not good quality)</p>
