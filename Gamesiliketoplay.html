  <h1>Welcome to the Games tab, here are recommendations for games that I enjoy to play and play a lot of.</h1>
    
  <h3> Game 1: League of Legends</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">League of Legends is a tactical team based MOBA where 2 teams of 5 compete to destroy each other's Nexus. In this game
    death is likely but sometimes required for the victory of your team. This game is for you if you have quick reaction times
    and a good awareness for spatial surroundings. Players with these assets will thrive once they learn the game, although
    less advanced players and those who play more-so for fun are able to enjoy the game as well since they match you with
    others of the same skill level. </p>

  <h3> Game 2: Ark Survival Evolved</h3>

    <p class="paragraph"> Ark Survival Evolved is centered around dinos, being able to tame, mount, and ride them into battle.
    Ark is kinda like Minecraft where you have to gather resources, construct a house, and get armor/weapons to fend of foes.
    The difference now being that in Ark one must use their Tamed Dinos to beat the game rather than with their own power.
    This game is great for people who enjoy Sand Boxes and being able to do just about anything with a large PVP community as well.</p>

  <h3> Game 3: Valorant</h3>
    <p class="paragraph"> Valorant is a tactical shooter game much like Counter Strike: Global Offensive, but with superhuman abilities or technology rather than current
    military weapons. This game is a lot of fun for people who enjoy shooters and game modes like Search and Destroy or Elimination. It does not bode well for people
    who get angry at games. My current rank in the game is Diamond 1.
